## Development Log and Build Plan

This document tracks progress, decisions, and step-by-step actions to build the Shopify Remix app for generating and hosting XML product feeds.

### Working Conventions
- OS: Windows 10/11 (PowerShell)
- Package manager: npm
- Runtime: Node 18+
- DB: Postgres via Prisma
- Storage: S3-compatible (Cloudflare R2 recommended)
- Queue: BullMQ + Redis
- App framework: Remix with Shopify App libraries

---

## Goals
- Generate Google Shopping-compatible XML feeds from Shopify products/variants
- Multiple feeds per shop with mappings, filters, schedules
- Host XML on S3/R2 with public URL
- UI for landing page, editor tabs (Info/Settings/Mapping/Filters/Schedules)
- Webhooks + scheduled jobs to refresh feeds

## Step-by-Step Build

### 1) Scaffold the Shopify Remix App

Use Shopifyâ€™s app template for Remix:

```powershell
# Used Shopify CLI to scaffold into web/feed-manager
shopify app init --template remix --name feed-manager --path web -d npm
```

If the path is occupied, scaffold to a subfolder and move files as needed. During init, select the necessary scopes later in config.

Install commonly used dependencies:

```powershell
npm i @shopify/shopify-api @shopify/shopify-app-remix
npm i @prisma/client zod @aws-sdk/client-s3 bullmq ioredis he xmlbuilder2
npm i -D prisma @types/node tsx
```

Notes:
- `xmlbuilder2` for streaming XML writing
- `he` for HTML entity decoding and description sanitization

Scaffold result:
- App root: `web/feed-manager`
- Key files: `app/shopify.server.ts`, `app/routes/*`, `prisma/schema.prisma`, `shopify.app.toml`, `shopify.web.toml`

### 2) Configure Environment Variables

Create `.env` (do not commit secrets). For Neon, set `sslmode=require`:

```dotenv
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DBNAME?sslmode=require

# Shopify
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=...
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=...
SHOPIFY_SCOPES=read_products,read_product_listings,read_locales,read_markets
SHOPIFY_APP_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...

# Storage (R2 or S3)
S3_ENDPOINT=https://<accountid>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
S3_REGION=auto
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
S3_BUCKET=shop-feeds
FEED_CDN_BASE=https://cdn.example.com/feeds

# Redis for BullMQ
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

### 3) Postgres and Redis (Local)

With Docker Desktop on Windows:

```powershell
docker run --name pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=feed_manager -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:16
docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis:7
```

### 4) Prisma Initialization and Schema

```powershell
npx prisma init
```

Update `prisma/schema.prisma` datasource to `provider = "postgresql"` and `url = env("DATABASE_URL")`. App models added for feeds, mappings, filters, schedules, runs, and optional DB-stored XML (`FeedAsset`). Then run:

```powershell
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Generate the client (usually automatic on migrate):

```powershell
npx prisma generate
```

### 5) App Structure (Remix routes and folders)

Create the following high-level routes and modules:
- `app/routes/_auth.shopify.tsx` â€“ OAuth install/callback
- `app/routes/feeds._index.tsx` â€“ Feeds list (landing)
- `app/routes/feeds.new.tsx` â€“ New feed wizard
- `app/routes/feeds.$feedId.tsx` â€“ Editor tabs (Info, Settings, Mapping, Filters, Schedules)
- `app/routes/api/feeds.$feedId.generate.ts` â€“ POST enqueue
- `app/routes/feeds.$feedId.xml.ts` â€“ GET redirect/token verify
- `app/routes/api/webhooks.shopify.ts` â€“ Webhooks receiver

Modules (suggested):
- `app/db/*` â€“ Prisma client, repositories
- `app/services/shopify/*` â€“ Shopify GraphQL clients and queries
- `app/services/storage/*` â€“ S3/R2 client and upload helpers
- `app/services/feeds/*` â€“ XML generator, mapping, filters, validation
- `app/services/queue/*` â€“ BullMQ setup, workers, job types

### 6) Storage Adapter (R2/S3)

Implement a thin wrapper around `@aws-sdk/client-s3`:
- `putObject(key, body, contentType)`
- `getPublicUrl(key)` â†’ `FEED_CDN_BASE` + key or R2 public endpoint
- Content-Type: `application/xml; charset=utf-8`

### 7) Queue and Worker

- Create a BullMQ queue `feed-generation`
- Worker takes `{ feedId }`, pulls DB state, fetches products via Shopify GraphQL, applies filters/mappings, writes XML, uploads object, updates `Feed`
- Concurrency: tune by catalog size; add backoff/retry

### 8) XML Generator (Google)

Implement streaming builder for RSS with `g` namespace:
- `g:id`, `g:item_group_id`, `title`, `description`, `link`, `g:image_link`, `g:availability`, `g:price`, `g:sale_price`, `g:google_product_category`, `g:product_type`, `g:brand`, `g:gtin`, `g:mpn`, `g:identifier_exists`, `g:condition`
- Strip HTML from description; ensure UTF-8
- Use presentment prices for currency where possible

### 9) Webhooks and Regeneration

- Subscribe: `products/create|update|delete`
- On webhook: enqueue regeneration (debounce per feed)

### 10) UI

- Landing: table with Name | Status | Feed Link | Last Updated | Action
- Editor tabs with forms for Info/Settings/Mapping/Filters/Schedules
- Limit feeds by plan; show upgrade CTA when max reached

### 11) Testing

- Unit tests: mapping rules, filters, price calculations
- Snapshot tests: XML output for representative items
- Integration: enqueue job â†’ mock upload â†’ DB updated with `publicUrl`

### 12) Run in Dev

```powershell
# Start Remix
npm run dev

# Start worker (adjust script to use tsx or ts-node)
npm run worker:dev

# Tunnel for Shopify
ngrok http 3000
```

## Decision Log

- 2025-08-07: Use Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible) for cost and CDN
- 2025-08-07: Use BullMQ over simple setInterval for reliability
- 2025-08-07: Store feeds per shop with tokenized access via redirect route

---

## Open Questions

- Do we need additional channels (Meta, Pinterest) in first release?
- Should feeds be per market with automatic multi-language content?
- Do we enforce GTIN/MPN completeness or just warn?

---

## Verification Checklist (Google XML)

- [ ] XML validates and is well-formed
- [ ] Required fields present per Google specs
- [ ] Prices include currency; sale < price when present
- [ ] Links/images are HTTPS and reachable
- [ ] Language and country match feed settings
- [ ] Large catalogs stream without memory issues

---

## Definition of Done (MVP)

- Shop installs the app and authorizes
- User creates a feed, maps fields, sets filters and a schedule
- Generation produces a valid XML and uploads to storage
- Public URL can be submitted to Google Merchant Center
- Webhooks and schedules keep the feed fresh
